// Runner -- the autonomous player, driving a live Client.
//
// This is the M4 counterpart of bot::Scenario, and the difference is the whole
// point of the milestone. A Scenario is a LIST: travel, chop, bank, logout, in
// that order, decided by a human before the run. A Runner is a LOOP: observe,
// assess needs, score goals, commit to one, act, and re-decide. Nothing here
// says what to do next; the planner does, from what the character can see.
//
// Like Scenario, it talks to Client's PUBLIC API only. It has no access to
// sockets, packets or protocol state, and every action it starts is a request
// the server may refuse -- which is what makes "the bot must play the game" a
// structural property rather than a promise.
